## The Background of OET

The OET was initially created in Australia. Professor Tim McNamara, who had previously worked on the IELTS exam, a significant English testing system, founded it in Australia in the late 1980s.

The OET is always evolving, and only in the last two years, several substantial changes have been made. This is due to the fact that it is continually evaluated and modified to keep it in line with medical standards. The University of Melbourne, which is in charge of the test's administration, makes sure that it is constantly modified for the benefit of governments and healthcare facilities all over the world that depend on it to evaluate applicants' English proficiency.The medical field is evolving, and the OET too.

## The Objective of OET

This is not a generic English test that anyone can take and utilize for general immigration purposes, unlike IELTS or TOEFL. Instead, this exam is specifically created for healthcare professionals who want to relocate to an English-speaking nation and must demonstrate their language proficiency in order to be admitted.

OET Covers Healthcare Professions

The OET specifically covers a number of healthcare occupations. These include the following 12 top healthcare professions:

7. Pharmacy
8. Physiotherapy

OET is widely acknowledged in nations such the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Ukraine, Dubai, Singapore, and Namibia, to name a few.  The OET, which was created expressly for the healthcare sector, paves the way for OET candidates to work or study in the medical sector while also assisting test-takers in learning the language that healthcare professionals are expected to be familiar with on the job.

## OET Scoring Method

The OET test was graded on a scale from E to A prior to September 2018, with E obviously being the lowest and A being the highest. However, the approach was altered in September, and now candidates are graded using a numerical ranking system, with 500 representing the greatest possible score.

These results line up with descriptions of a person's skill level for each band. A person with a score of 450 to 500 (formerly a band A) might, for instance, "speak very fluently and effectively with patients and healthcare professionals." This provides a ton of useful information about the candidate to potential companies or immigration officials.

## OET Exam Costs

The price of the OET exam is $587 AUD, or its equivalent in local currency. This price includes the booking charge and represents the total cost of the four subtests.

## OET Test Dates

There are at least one OET tests held each month in at least 40 different nations, for a total of 14 tests per year. Candidates must make reservations far in advance to guarantee they can take the exam at the time and venue of their choice because not every test for every healthcare profession is offered every month. Application deadlines are several weeks before the exam date, therefore it's crucial to make reservations early.



## Language Tests in the OET


These four categories of English language proficiency are examined by the examination, which includes a "sub-test" for each one.

Reading Listening Writing Speaking

All applicants must complete some portions of the test, but others are only relevant to those particular fields of study. This means that although some papers are generic for all professions, others are industry-specific.

The Reading, Listening, and Speaking sub-tests are generic tests that apply to all OET occupations, whereas the Writing and Speaking sub-tests are unique to a given profession.



### Reading

* This sub-test is general and is the same across all the OET healthcare professions
* Consists of 3 parts – Part A, B and C
* Has a total of 42 questions (20 questions in Part A, 6 questions in Part B and 16 questions in Part C)
* **15 minutes** to complete Part A and **45 minutes** to complete Part B and Part C (combined).
* Part A questions require short answers
* Part B and Part C consist of objective questions



### Listening



* This sub-test is general and is the same across all the OET healthcare professions
* Consists of 3 parts – Part A, B and C
* Has a total of 42 questions (24 questions in Part A, 6 questions in Part B and 12 questions in Part C)
* Time runs according to the audio recordings although candidates will be given 1-2 minutes to check their answers after each section

* In Part B, candidates will hear 6 different recordings and will have to answer an objective question after each recording

This sub-test is profession specific and is different for each of the OET healthcare professions

* The reading time allocated is 5 minutes and candidates only have 40 minutes after that to write the letter
