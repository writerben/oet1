# What is IELTS?

The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) was created to assist you in moving to a country where English is the dominant language in order to work, study, or move. This includes the USA, UK, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and others.

During the test, your proficiency in speaking, reading, and writing English will be evaluated. IELTS is scored on a scale from 1 to 9.

The British Council, IDP: IELTS Australia, and Cambridge English all jointly own IELTS.

## IELTS: Why take it?

You must be able to demonstrate a high level of English language proficiency if you want to work, reside, or study in an English-speaking country.

With 379 million speakers globally, English is the third most widely spoken language.

There are several advantages to being able to speak in the national tongue of the country you want to work or study in. Additionally, it is necessary for community integration and job prospects.

For people wishing to immigrate to countries like Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK, IELTS is the test of choice. More than 11,000 employers, universities, schools, and immigration agencies around the world, including 3,400 institutions in the USA, recognize it.

## What IELTS score should I aim for?


The better your IELTS score, the more effective and proficient your English communication skills are. Specific IELTS score requirements will apply to each immigration body, university, workplace, or institution. Whether you want to work or study in the country will determine the score you need.
